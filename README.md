# Weather Forecaster HW6

## Project Information
I made the skeleton page with html and bootstrap to make it somewhat appealing.
After that I included jquery and ajax to the javascript.
After getting all the necessary info from the OpenWeather API, I added
that information to be populated to the page. This information includes, city, temp,
humidity, wind speed, weather icon, and date.

The date was changed over from milliseconds as is customary on a number of programs and computers.
The weather icons were pulled from the openweather API icon page.
